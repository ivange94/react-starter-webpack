# react-starter-webpack
A react started configured from scratch with webpack and babel.

## Introduction

If you're starting a new React project, the recommended way is to use [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app). But in those rare occassions where you need to configure your own React project from scratch, this template is for you. This gives you control of webpack beyond what's provided by create-react-app.

## Features
- Support for `.jsx` extensions

## Setup

### Clone the project
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/ivange94/react-starter-webpack.git appName
```

Where `appName` represents the app you're trying to build

### Build

```console
$ cd appName
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a `/dist` folder with you can deploy.

### Run development server

```console
$ npm start
```

This will spin up a dev server on http://localhost:8080/ with live reload enabled.


Happy Coding!!!
